# EXAMPLE WORKFLOW - Email Validator

This is an **EXAMPLE** folder demonstrating the agent handoff structure. 

**This is NOT real agent output** - it was manually created to show the ideal folder organization and file formats.

The feature demonstrated here (email-validator) is intentionally different from any actual features being developed to avoid confusion.

## Purpose
- Shows the complete workflow from planning to final approval
- Demonstrates proper file naming and numbering
- Provides templates for each handoff format
- Illustrates the progression of data through agents

For actual agent outputs, see other folders like `redis-integration-actual/`.
